## 3-Second Quick Deployment

<!-- ### 🧙 One-Click Script Deployment (Recommended)
```shell
curl -fsSL "http://echo.soopy.cn/install.sh" -o install_ech0.sh && bash install_ech0.sh
``` -->

### 🐳 Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name ech0 \
  -p 6277:6277 \
  -v /opt/ech0/data:/app/data \
  -e JWT_SECRET="Hello Echos!" \
  sn0wl1n/ech0:latest
```

> 💡 After deployment, visit `ip:6277` to use
> 🚷 It is recommended to change `"Hello Echos!"` in `JWT_SECRET` for better security
> 📍 The first registered account becomes the administrator (currently only admins can publish content)
> 🎈 Data is stored under `/opt/ech0/data`

### 🐋 Docker Compose Deployment

Create a new directory and put the `docker-compose.yml` file inside it.

Then run the following command in that directory:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

# ❓ FAQ

1. **What is Ech0?**
   Ech0 is a lightweight open-source self-hosted platform designed for quick idea sharing. It provides a clean interface and distraction-free writing, with all data stored locally for full control.

2. **What is Ech0 not?**
   Ech0 is not a traditional note-taking tool (like Obsidian or Notion). It functions more like a personal feed or “status update” platform.

3. **Is Ech0 free?**
   Yes, Ech0 is completely free and open-source under the AGPL-3.0 License. No ads, no tracking, no subscriptions, and no service dependencies.

4. **How to back up and restore data?**
   All content is stored in a local SQLite file. Simply back up the `/opt/ech0/data` directory. To restore, just copy the backup files back.

5. **Does Ech0 support RSS?**
   Yes, Ech0 supports RSS subscriptions for content updates.

6. **Why do I get a "contact admin" error when publishing?**
   Only administrators can publish content. The first registered user becomes the admin. Assign admin rights to others via the settings.

7. **Why isn’t there a full permission system?**
   Ech0 is designed to be simple and lightweight, avoiding complexity in permission management. Only admin vs non-admin roles exist for now. Simplicity over complexity.

8. **Why can’t others see my Connect avatar?**
   Make sure you set the `Instance URL` under `System Settings` to your deployment domain, e.g., `https://memo.vaaat.com`. It must include `http` or `https`.

9. **What is the MetingAPI setting for?**
   This API is used to fetch streaming music links for the music card feature. If unset, the default hosted version will be used (deployed via Vercel).

10. **Why do some Connect entries not show?**
    The backend fetches data from all connected instances. If one is down or unreachable, it will be excluded from results.

11. **What content is not recommended for Ech0?**
   Ech0 published content consists of three parts: text, images, and extended content (such as music, video player cards). Ech0 does not recommend publishing dense content that simultaneously includes `text + images + extended content`, as this violates some of Ech0's design principles. Additionally, publishing extended content or lengthy articles is not recommended at any time.

12. **How do I enable the comment feature?**  
   Go to the settings page and enter your deployed Twikoo backend address in the `Comment API` field to enable comments automatically. Currently, only [Twikoo](https://twikoo.js.org/) is supported.

# 🛠️ Development

## **Backend Requirements:**

📌 **Go 1.25.1+**

📌 **C Compiler**
Required for libraries like `go-sqlite3` that use CGO:

* Windows:

  * [MinGW-w64](https://winlibs.com/)
  * Add `bin` folder to PATH
* macOS: `brew install gcc`
* Linux: `sudo apt install build-essential`

📌 **Google Wire**
Install [wire](https://github.com/google/wire) for dependency injection code generation:

* `go install github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire@latest`

📌 **Golangci-Lint**  
Install [Golangci-Lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) for linting and formatting:  
- Run `golangci-lint run` in the project root directory for linting  
- Run `golangci-lint fmt` in the project root directory for formatting  

## **Frontend Requirements:**

📌  **NodeJS v24.5.0, PNPM v10.15.1**

> Tip: Use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for managing multiple Node versions.

---

## **Start Frontend & Backend Together**

**Step 1: Backend (in Ech0 root directory):**

```shell
go run cmd/ech0/main.go # Compile and start backend
```

> If DI has changed, regenerate `wire_gen.go` in `ech0/internal/di/` using `wire` command.

**Step 2: Frontend (new terminal):**

```shell
cd web # Enter frontend folder

pnpm install # Run if dependencies are not installed

pnpm dev # Start frontend preview
```

**Step 3: Access:**
Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
Backend: [http://localhost:6277](http://localhost:6277) (default)
